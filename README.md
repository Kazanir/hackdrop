# Hackutils!

For the love of all that is holy, do not install this module if you value your sanity.

With that said. This module is a suite of attempts to leverage the cooler features of the Hack language for Drupal. Hack is a dialect of PHP (mostly a superset, but with some key dynamic features removed) which runs on Facebook's HHVM runtime. 

While forking Drupal into Hack is not realistic or really wise (nor do I have time to maintain such a monstrosity) I hope that the various extensions included here can help an enterprising Drupal developer make use of the coolest parts of the language, especially the async I/O libraries that potentially allow significant performance gains on an I/O-heavy page request.
